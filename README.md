Be sure to completely thaw the broccoli.  I didn&#039;t and it didn&#039;t get done in time specified.  Just cooked it a little longer though and it was perfect.

I used a 10-oz bag of chopped broccoli and a 10-oz bag of flowerettes which gave it more texture. Very good flavor and the smell while cooking was great. The sauce held it together without overwhelming the broccoli. |            5 |      194.8 |          20 |       6 |       32 |        22 |              36 |               3 |
